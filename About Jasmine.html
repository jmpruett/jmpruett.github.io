		<div class= Main_head Style= margin-left:5%>Hello, </div>
		<P> My name is <span class= Jasmine>Jasmine Marceline Pruett</span>. I am an open and inviting, people-oriented young professional with public relations, 
		social media marketing, event planning, and hospitality experience. I am also trained 
		in public speaking and have experience pioneering new positions.</P>
		<P> In 2016, I graduated from UGA with Bachlor's degrees in German and Linguistics. It was my dream 
		to get my PHD and become a university professor, but the more I learned about the current climate 
		of Academia, the less that reality seemed like the dream. It is the experience of many that no 
		matter how hard you work or how good you are; academia is very unstable and opportunities are few 
		and often luck based. For this reason, I took a year off. Gained work experience, talked to every 
		mentor that would listen, and made the hardest decision of my life.</P>
		<p>I let go of my ivory tower dream and returned to school, not for my Masters as had been 	
		the plan, but instead as a Undergrad once again to seek a Bachlor's Degree in Marketing. 	
		Marketing combines the people and community-driven nature of German with the logical and 	
		structural elements of Linguistics. Through very community oriented internships and positions, 	
		I have come to find that this is not only something I enjoy, but also something at which I excel. 
		I am so thankful to everyone, who helped me to this point and am ready to work harder 
		than ever before. </p>
